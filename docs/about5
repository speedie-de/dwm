-- Switching run launcher --
Some users may prefer to use a different run launcher than dmenu.
Previously all scripts bundled would only run dmenu from $PATH but you can now switch run launcher very easily.
  - Edit options.h and change RUN to your run launcher
  - Add "export RUNLAUNCHER=<runlauncher>" to your .<shell>rc

Run launchers must support dmenu arguments because otherwise scripts are going to be incompatible.
It must also support the additional '-g' argument that the dmenu grid patch provides unless you modify the scripts bundled.
Keep in mind that if you use a different run launcher, it may not support Pywal/.Xresources.
