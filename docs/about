-- What is dwm? --
dwm or dynamic window manager is a window manager. It manages the user's open windows and tiles them according to a set layout (dynamic). 
This fork has more features and keybinds.

Tiling window managers (unlike floating window managers that you may be used to) tile windows based on a set layout making them easy to get productive on. 
They also encourage the user to use their keyboard instead of the mouse so that the user doesn't have to move their hands much.

-- Installation --
In order to install this build of dwm, all dependencies must be installed.
You can see (Dependencies) for a list of all dependencies required to use this fork.

  - git clone https://github.com/speedie-de/dwm
  - cd dwm
  - make clean install
    - If any warnings show up, fix it by installing the missing dependency.
  - If a .xinitrc is used, add 'dwm_run' to the end.
    - NOTE: Your .xinitrc should ONLY contain 'dwm_run'. dwm will automatically start everything else. If not, edit autostart.h and 'make clean install'. If a .xinitrc is not used then you don't need to worry. A .desktop file is automatically created when you run 'make clean install'.
