-- Dependencies --
  These are absolutely necessary, dwm will NOT compile without them
  - libxft-bgra (Can be installed through 'make <distro>-libxftfix')
    - NOTE: libXft will do but will cause dwm and as such all your applications to crash if a colored emoji is displayed in the status bar.
  - libXinerama
    - Can be disabled through editing config.mk if you're not interested in multiple monitors.
  - imlib2
  
  -- Features --
  These are dependencies if you wanna use certain features
  NOTE: Do not add any of these to .xinitrc or similar. They are going to be autostarted by dwm.
  If you want to use an alternative, change it in options.h.

    - NOTE: dmenu is required for most scripts included with this build of dwm.
