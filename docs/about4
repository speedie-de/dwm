-- Fsignal --
Thanks to the 'fsignal' patch available on suckless.org's website, we can easily write shell scripts to interact with dwm.
This is exactly what I did and dwmutils, swal, dwmshutdown and more take advantage of it.

In order to use 'fsignal', your system must have 'xsetroot' installed.
Then you can simply run or add "xsetroot -name 'fsignal:<signum>'" to your script.

Below is a list of all signums and what they do.
