-- Important --
If you're used to dwm, this build might be a little bit unfamiliar to you. This is because this build doesn't use config.h (or config.def.h).
Instead, config.h is split into different parts to make it easier to edit. Instead of editing config.h you'll want to edit:

  - autostart.h for starting stuff right before dwm (For example xclip, pywal, etc.)
  - options.h for changing colors and applications to use with keybinds.
  - fsignal.h for adding fake signals
  - colors.h for changing alpha options, most users won't need to edit it.
  - xresources.h for adding .Xresources options
  - rules.h for adding rules
  - keybinds.h for adding/removing keybinds.

After you've edited one of the files, you need to run 'make clean install' to reinstall dwm.
Remember that you can change colors through your .Xresources file (see .Xresources and Pywal) meaning you do not need to recompile dwm.

Another important detail you must keep in mind is that this build comes with a status bar simply named 'status'.
It can be found in the dwm source code directory. It is just a shell script which adds stuff to your status bar. It will automatically be started when dwm starts.

You can edit the status bar simply by editing 'status' and running 'make clean install'.
Please note that most status bars including the built in 'status' depends on xsetroot which must be installed.

If you want to change status bar, edit options.h and set 'static char status' to your status bar binary (must be in $PATH).
Alternatively, you can also set "dwm.status: <statusbar>" in .Xresources (See .Xresources and Pywal)


-- .Xresources and Pywal --
This fork of dwm has .Xresources support thanks to the .Xresources patch.
It also has pywal support (tool which grabs colors based on your wallpaper).

Colors reload automagically because of a reloadxresources function this build has combined with fsignal and a wallpaper script I wrote.
Therefore, if you want colors to reload instantly, you're unfortunately forced to use the bundled wallpaper script.

If you want to use another script, you can open up dwmutils and select 'Reload .Xresources' to reload .Xresources.
Alternatively, you can write a script yourself (xsetroot -name "fsignal:18" reloads the colors)

Below is a list of all .Xresources values you can define. The .Xresources file should be placed in ~ or ~/.config by the user.
If it is not or you want it somewhere else, you can edit 'autostart.h' and 'make clean install'.

Note that the 'xrdb' dependency is required for both pywal and .Xresources support and 'xsetroot' is required for automatic reloading of colors.
