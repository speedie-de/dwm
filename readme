speedie's dynamic window manager build readme 
=============================================

REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
=====================
This build of dwm REQUIRES the following software to be installed:
* libXinerama (Optional if you don't need multiple monitors if you edit config.mk)
* libXft-bgra (Required for color emojis, otherwise dwm will crash.)
* imlib2      (Required to render icons)

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES
=====================
If you want additional features, such as 'swal', these are also required:
* xwallpaper  (Required for the built in way of setting wallpapers aka Control+Alt+Shift+s)
* dmenu (Required for many scripts built in.)
* xrdb (Required for pywal support)
* pywal (Required for.. pywal support)

This build of dwm comes with binds for software. These must be installed by default but you can change the binds through changing the defines at the top.
* st (Terminal)
* tabbed (Tabs for the web browser)
* vimb (Web browser)
* htop (Status monitor)
* newsboat (RSS reader)
* zathura (PDF reader)
* alsa*utils (Required for audio controls)
* mocp (Default music player)
* vim (Text editor)
* neomutt (Email client)
* maim (Screenshot tool, automatically copies to clipboard using xclip)
* vifm (File manager)
* slock (Lock screen)
* weechat (IRC client)
* tmux (Recommended if you're using weechat)

INSTALLING DWM
==============
In order to install this build of dwm, simply run 'make clean install' as root. If it fails, install the missing dependencies.
Do not install libXft using your distro's package manager. Instead run 'make <distro>-libxftfix' as root.
For example on Gentoo, run 'make gentoo-libxftfix', on Arch, 'make arch-libxftfix', etc.

If your distribution is not available, run 'make libxftfix'. This will manually compile libXft-bgra. Only do this if you absolutely need to.

USAGE
=====
If you use xinit/sx, add this to .xinitrc

while true; do
  dwm
done

Then startx/sx sh /path/to/xinitrc

Your .xinitrc should NOT have xclip, wal -R, picom, or xrdb in it unless you need to. You'll probably also want to avoid using other wallpaper tools because the one bundled with this build has dwm specific features. These should be automatically started by dwm in the autostart function. (In config.def.h)

SETTING YOUR WALLPAPER
======================
If the required and optional dependencies are met, you can set your wallpaper by pressing Control+Alt+Shift+s. This will bring up a dmenu prompt with a list of wallpapers in the set directory. Default is ~/Wallpapers but it can be changed.

Simply select your wallpaper. Whenever dwm is started, the wallpaper is automatically set along with the pywal settings if pywal is enabled/used.

HELP IM STUPID
=============
Don't worry. You can easily get some help by pressing Control+Alt+h inside dwm. If you're not capable of that then you're probably not capable of using dwm anyway.
