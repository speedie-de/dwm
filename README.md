# speedie's fork of dynamic window manager

## What is dwm?
dwm or dynamic window manager is a window manager. It manages the user's open windows and tiles them according to a set layout (dynamic). 
This fork has more features and keybinds.

Tiling window managers (unlike floating window managers that you may be used to) tile windows based on a set layout making them easy to get productive on. 
They also encourage the user to use their keyboard instead of the mouse so that the user doesn't have to move their hands much.

## Installation
In order to install this build of dwm, all dependencies must be installed.
You can see (Dependencies) for a list of all dependencies required to use this fork.

  - git clone https://github.com/speedie-de/dwm
  - cd dwm
  - make clean install
    - If any warnings show up, fix it by installing the missing dependency.
  - If a .xinitrc is used, add 'dwm_run' to the end.
    - NOTE: Your .xinitrc should ONLY contain 'dwm_run'. dwm will automatically start everything else. If not, edit autostart.h and 'make clean install'. If a .xinitrc is not used then you don't need to worry. A .desktop file is automatically created when you run 'make clean install'.

## Layouts
This fork of dwm comes with the following layouts:

  - Tile
  - Monocle
  - Grid
  - Deck
  - Centered Master
  - Centered Floating Master
  - Spiral
  - Dwindle
  - Three Column
  - Bottom Stack
  - Horizontal Bottom Stack
  - Horizonal Grid
  - Tatami
  - Tilewide
  - Stairs

They can be switched between using a little menu (See Keybinds for more information)
The more commonly used layouts can be switched between using a quick keybind.

## Dependencies
  These are absolutely necessary, dwm will NOT compile without them
  - libxft-bgra (Can be installed through 'make <distro>-libxftfix')
    - NOTE: libXft will do but will cause dwm and as such all your applications to crash if a colored emoji is displayed in the status bar.
  - libXinerama
    - Can be disabled through editing config.mk if you're not interested in multiple monitors.
  - imlib2
  
  ## Features
  These are dependencies if you wanna use certain features
  NOTE: Do not add any of these to .xinitrc or similar. They are going to be autostarted by dwm.
  If you want to use an alternative, change it in options.h.
  - dmenu
    - NOTE: dmenu is required for most scripts included with this build of dwm. My build is required for Pywal support.
	- NOTE 2: The build must have the 'grid' patch. If yours does not have this, you can patch it in or get my build here: https://github.com/speedie-de/dmenu
  - picom
  - xclip (Required for clipboard support by a few scripts, will start automatically)
  - xwallpaper (Required to set wallpapers automatically)
  - xmodmap (Install if you want Escape instead of Caps Lock and Right Super+hjkl for arrow keys)
  - xrdb (Install if you want .Xresources support)
  - pywal (Install if you want pywal support. Requires swal aka the default way to set wallpapers)
  - wmctrl (Needed for proper window management)
  - xsetroot (Needed for most scripts including Pywal support)
  - slock (Required for screen locking)
  - maim (Required for built in 'dwm-screenshotutil' script)
  
  ## Software
  This build of dwm comes with binds for software. 
  These must be installed by default but you can change what software is required by editing 'options.h' and running 'make clean install'.
  You can also remove keybinds by editing 'keybinds.h' and running 'make clean install'.
  - st (Terminal)
  - firefox (Web browser)
  - htop (Status monitor)
  - newsboat (RSS reader)
  - zathura (PDF reader)
  - alsa-utils (Required for audio controls)
  - mocp (Default music player)
  - vim (Text editor)
  - neomutt (Email client)
  - maim (Screenshot tool, automatically copies to clipboard using xclip)
  - vifm (File manager)
  - slock (Lock screen)
  And everything under 'Features'.
  
## Important
If you're used to dwm, this build might be a little bit unfamiliar to you. This is because this build doesn't use config.h (or config.def.h).
Instead, config.h is split into different parts to make it easier to edit. Instead of editing config.h you'll want to edit:

  - autostart.h for starting stuff right before dwm (For example xclip, pywal, etc.)
  - options.h for changing colors and applications to use with keybinds.
  - fsignal.h for adding fake signals
  - colors.h for changing alpha options, most users won't need to edit it.
  - xresources.h for adding .Xresources options
  - rules.h for adding rules
  - keybinds.h for adding/removing keybinds.

After you've edited one of the files, you need to run 'make clean install' to reinstall dwm.
Remember that you can change colors through your .Xresources file (see .Xresources and Pywal) meaning you do not need to recompile dwm.

Another important detail you must keep in mind is that this build comes with a status bar simply named 'status'.
It can be found in the dwm source code directory. It is just a shell script which adds stuff to your status bar. It will automatically be started when dwm starts.

You can edit the status bar simply by editing 'status' and running 'make clean install'.
Please note that most status bars including the built in 'status' depends on xsetroot which must be installed.

If you want to change status bar, edit options.h and set 'static char status' to your status bar binary (must be in $PATH).
Alternatively, you can also set dwm.status: <statusbar> in .Xresources (See .Xresources and Pywal)


## .Xresources and Pywal
This fork of dwm has .Xresources support thanks to the .Xresources patch.
It also has pywal support (tool which grabs colors based on your wallpaper).

Colors reload automagically because of a reloadxresources function this build has combined with fsignal and a wallpaper script I wrote.
Therefore, if you want colors to reload instantly, you're unfortunately forced to use the bundled wallpaper script.

If you want to use another script, you can open up dwmutils and select 'Reload .Xresources' to reload .Xresources.
Alternatively, you can write a script yourself (18 reloads the colors)

Below is a list of all .Xresources values you can define. The .Xresources file should be placed in ~ or ~/.config by the user.
If it is not or you want it somewhere else, you can edit 'autostart.h' and 'make clean install'.

Note that the 'xrdb' dependency is required for both pywal and .Xresources support and 'xsetroot' is required for automatic reloading of colors.

## Fsignal
Thanks to the 'fsignal' patch available on suckless.org's website, we can easily write shell scripts to interact with dwm.
This is exactly what I did and dwm-utils, dwm-swal, dwm-shutdown and more take advantage of it.

In order to use 'fsignal', your system must have 'xsetroot' installed.
Then simply use the dwm-utils script. Syntax is dwm-utils -exec <signum>

Below is a list of all signums and what they do.

  - 1  | Switch to the Tiling layout
  - 2  | Switch to the Floating layout
  - 3  | Switch to the Monocle layout
  - 4  | Switch to the Grid layout
  - 5  | Switch to the Deck layout
  - 6  | Switch to the Centered Master layout
  - 7  | Switch to the Centered Floating Master layout

## Switching run launcher
Some users may prefer to use a different run launcher than dmenu.
Previously all scripts bundled would only run dmenu from $PATH but you can now switch run launcher very easily.
  - Edit options.h and change RUN to your run launcher
  - Add export RUNLAUNCHER=<runlauncher> to your .<shell>rc

Run launchers must support dmenu arguments because otherwise scripts are going to be incompatible.
It must also support the additional '-g' argument that the dmenu grid patch provides unless you modify the scripts bundled.
Keep in mind that if you use a different run launcher, it may not support Pywal/.Xresources.
