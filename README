This is speedie's build of dwm. It has been heavily modified.
It will work out of the box providing all the dependencies are installed however you will be missing out.

(1)
You must edit the dwm-applications file and change all settings to options that your system has/supports.

(2)
This build of dwm supports .Xresources. To use it, place the .Xresources file anywhere on your system and
make sure xrdb "/path/to/.Xresources" is loaded when you start X.

(3)
This build of dwm supports pywal. To use it, make sure pywal is set up and working.
Then add these lines to your .xinitrc
- /path/to/your/regular/.Xresorces
- Something to set your wallpaper with
- wal -R
- ~/.config/dwm/wal.sh
- xrdb -merge ~/.cache/wal/colors.Xresources

(4)
To see the keybinds, read the config.def.h.

(5)
This build assumes your dwm binary and source code will be located in ~/.config/dwm.
Changing this may cause problems.
